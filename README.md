## Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs for Library Information System

### Functional Requirements: 

- Option for login and signup when the user opens the portal.
- Function for the user to search for the books in the library based on the book's title, Author, Publication date, etc., according to their requirements.
- Maintain a database of books with details like the date it was purchased, and cost and maintain a history of users who have issued a particular book.
- Maintain different classes of users and provide them with different access permissions.
- Function of searching books based on the tags like fiction, biography, etc.
- The user's homepage should display books issued and the due date for returning issued books.
- There should be an option of reserving a book online and booking a book/magazine when no copies are available in the library.
- It can be made even easier if it provides an option for choosing different languages.


### Non-Functional Requirements
- Maintaining and  Updating information on the system should be made as easy as possible. The current system should work correctly even if any changes are made. If the system is updated with new features, it should work correctly withut taking down the website.
- Security features should be implemented that safeguard the data in the database.
- Encrypt data in the database to prevent any data breach and misuse of data by unauthorized personnel. 
- Make multiple redundant copies of data to recover the system in case of database corruption.
- Error handling and crash recovery should be implemented in the system.
- Interactive and user-friendly interface for better User Experience.
- Scalability should accommodate an increment in the number of users.
- Servers should be there in the local region for low latency access and a fast and smooth browsing experience on the website.


## Q2. - Sound Event Recognition App for Hearing-Impaired People
### Scope of users
- All those people who suffer some kind of hearing disability or ADHD disorder or any other disorder that makes it difficult for them to hear or understand the things around them.
- Family of people suffering from such diseases or disorders.
- Any people who want to keep this device with them as a safety measure or for any other purpose.

### Functional Requirements:
- The app should be precise and accurate in recognizing the sound events and be able to differentiate between the sound events.
- The app should be able to recognize the sound events in real-time and should be able to provide alerts to the user through different means like visual notifications, vibration, etc.
- The app should be able to provide the user with insights about the sound events and should be able to provide the user with information about the sound events.
- UI of the app should be user-friendly and guide users about the potential direction and proximity of the sound events.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- The app should be able to process the sound events in real-time using the AI algorithms by running them on the cloud with very low latency.
- The AI algorithm should be trained on a large dataset of sound events and fine-tuned for low-parameter models to reduce the prediction time and latency.
- The app should also provide an option for the user to provide data about the sound events to the app so that the app can be trained on the user's data and can provide better insights to the user.
- UI of the app should be designed to be very user-friendly so that the user can easily use the app and get insights about the sound events.
- Security of the user's data should be maintained, and the user's data should be encrypted and stored in the cloud.
- The app should be able to store a large number of users and process a large number of sound events in real-time without any lag or delay, as the user's life might depend on it.
